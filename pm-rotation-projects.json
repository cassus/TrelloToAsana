Front-ends on both sites would use the local Oracle RAC node for both datamodel/metamodel and session model, and a load balancer would be used to balance front-ends on each site. Then at local office level it could be determined whether to access site1 or site2.\n\nStill on the assumption of a very good network connection, but using SQL Server, it could be done with active-passive SQL Server mirroring: Front-ends on both sites would connect to primary SQL Server on Site1 and, in case of fail-over, fallback to SQL Server on Site2."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2013-09-21T07:25:50.245Z","memberCreator":{"id":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","avatarHash":"67b301c03b05014dd6d3bde709f32894","fullName":"Gonçalo Borrêga","initials":"GB","username":"goncaloborrega"}},{"id":"51ff758b61085620350010a4","idMemberCreator":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","data":{"board":{"name":"PM Rotation projects","id":"526930ef6d503d24380064c9"},"card":{"idShort":85,"name":"Sharepoint demo & technote improvements","id":"51ff753c5798985575003d36","desc":true},"old":{"desc":""}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2013-08-05T09:51:07.056Z","memberCreator":{"id":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","avatarHash":"67b301c03b05014dd6d3bde709f32894","fullName":"Gonçalo Borrêga","initials":"GB","username":"goncaloborrega"}},{"id":"51ff753c5798985575003d37","idMemberCreator":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","data":{"board":{"name":"PM Rotation projects","id":"526930ef6d503d24380064c9"},"list":{"name":"PM Rotation Projects","id":"51c841aa2b4f3fcb020023c0"},"card":{"idShort":85,"name":"Sharepoint demo & technote improvements","id":"51ff753c5798985575003d36"}},"type":"createCard","date":"2013-08-05T09:49:48.011Z","memberCreator":{"id":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","avatarHash":"67b301c03b05014dd6d3bde709f32894","fullName":"Gonçalo Borrêga","initials":"GB","username":"goncaloborrega"}},{"id":"51fa402ff13aec0d5000274d","idMemberCreator":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","data":{"board":{"name":"PM Rotation projects","id":"526930ef6d503d24380064c9"},"card":{"idShort":67,"name":"Disaster recovery technical note","id":"51c07d54ce5c0f4066000855"},"text":"Check and answer [Castelo's mail](https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/#inbox/13ff17e7ccece0d7) when done."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2013-08-01T11:02:07.733Z","memberCreator":{"id":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","avatarHash":"67b301c03b05014dd6d3bde709f32894","fullName":"Gonçalo Borrêga","initials":"GB","username":"goncaloborrega"}},{"id":"51c8b1b9a4859a28550004c8","idMemberCreator":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","data":{"board":{"name":"PM Rotation projects","id":"526930ef6d503d24380064c9"},"card":{"idShort":74,"name":"External Authentication scenarios technote","id":"51c8b15b8960b2b15400054e","desc":true},"old":{"desc":""}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2013-06-24T20:53:13.516Z","memberCreator":{"id":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","avatarHash":"67b301c03b05014dd6d3bde709f32894","fullName":"Gonçalo Borrêga","initials":"GB","username":"goncaloborrega"}},{"id":"51c8b15b8960b2b15400054f","idMemberCreator":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","data":{"board":{"name":"PM Rotation projects","id":"526930ef6d503d24380064c9"},"list":{"name":"PM Rotation Projects","id":"51c841aa2b4f3fcb020023c0"},"card":{"idShort":74,"name":"External Authentication scenarios technote","id":"51c8b15b8960b2b15400054e"}},"type":"createCard","date":"2013-06-24T20:51:39.791Z","memberCreator":{"id":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","avatarHash":"67b301c03b05014dd6d3bde709f32894","fullName":"Gonçalo Borrêga","initials":"GB","username":"goncaloborrega"}},{"id":"51c88acfa740ecc849000bac","idMemberCreator":"4f591652a018c97665a28d7f","data":{"board":{"name":"PM Rotation projects","id":"526930ef6d503d24380064c9"},"card":{"idShort":17,"name":"Licensing and Welcome letters process review for a better experience","id":"5152fe70b5caa92f16002d14","desc":true},"old":{"desc":"- General Welcome letters for first installation are very confusing\n- Error message in the platform after upgrading version is bad and should be tweaked to common use case (install new version without previously asking license upgrade - even though subscription allows it).
